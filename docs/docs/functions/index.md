# Functions
The entire `easy-dates` package is just a collection of functions. You'll find an explanation of how to use each function, and make the most of `easy-dates` in this section.

### Developer experience matters
If a function behaves differently than you would expect it to, or you wish `easy-dates` could do something that it currently can't, please do [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sandypockets/easy-dates/issues).
