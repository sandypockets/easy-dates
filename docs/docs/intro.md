# Welcome

:::caution
`easy-dates` is currently under heavy development, working towards a 1.0.0 release. Until then, it's possible (though I'll do my best to avoid it!) that there could be some breaking changes. For that reason, it is not recommended to use `easy-dates` in production _yet_.

Thanks for checking out `easy-dates`! 

If you've never used `easy-dates` before, then have a look at the [Getting started](introduction) section. It covers everything from adding the package to using it in a project. Otherwise, if you know what you're looking for, then take a look through the [Functions](functions) tab for full docs on everything.
