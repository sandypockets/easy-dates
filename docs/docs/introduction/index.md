# Getting started
`easy-dates` is a tiny, zero-dependency library intended to make working with JavaScript dates easier. 

It helps you ship compact code, that behaves consistently, and removes challenges like mixing up the millisecond clock that JavaScript uses with the seconds-based clock of Unix. 

Most importantly, `easy-dates` lets you focus on what you're building, instead of fiddling around with dates.
